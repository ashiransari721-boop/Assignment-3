			<p>Education is the <b>most powerful tool</b> that helps 			in shaping the <u>future</u> of students. It allows them 			to develop skills,<b> gain knowledge</b>, and <font color 			="blue">grow intellectually.</font><br>
			A good education opens doors to opportunities and helps 
			individuals make better decisions in life.</p>
		<h2>Why Education Matters</h2>
			<p>Education teaches us how to think critically, 				communicate effectively, and behave responsibly in 				society.
			It is not just about learning from books but about 				developing values and understanding the <b>importance of 				discipline</b></p>
			<p>As <abbr title="United Nations Education,Scientific and Cultural Organization">UNESCO</abbr> states, Education is a human right with 				immense power to transform.</p>
		<h2>Benefits of Being Educated</h2>
			<p>An educated person contributes positively to society. 			Education improves <u><b>self-confidence</b></u> and 				helps students to <u><b>achieve their goals</b></u> while 		        avoiding<br><b>bad habits</b></br> that destroy their potential.</p>

			<p>It enhances creativity and helps people solve real-				life problems effectively. For example, students learn 				that success can be represented by this simple 				        formula:</p>
			<p><b>Success</b> = Hard Work<sup>2</sup> + 					Consistencydailys</p>
		<h2>Role of Teachers and Parents</h2>
			<p>Teachers and parents play a <b>crucial role<b> in shaping 				the education of a child. They guide students to 				differentiate between right and wrong and inspire them to 			<u>believe in themselves</u>.</p>
			<p>According to <abbr title "World Health Organization>WHO</abbr>, emotional support from family 				and school increases a student’s ability to learn 				effectively.</p>
<br>
